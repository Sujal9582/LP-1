/*
 * This Java program implements the Best Fit memory allocation strategy, which
 * is used to assign processes to memory blocks efficiently. Hereâ€™s how it
 * works, step-by-step:
 * 
 * Key Concepts:
 * - Memory Blocks: These are fixed-sized memory units where processes can be
 *   stored.
 * - Processes: Each process has a certain memory requirement (size) that needs
 *   to be allocated to a block that fits it best.
 * 
 * How the Best Fit Strategy Works:
 * - For each process, the program searches through all blocks and finds the
 *   smallest block that can fit the process, ensuring minimal wastage of memory.
 * 
 * Output:
 * The program outputs a table displaying:
 * - Process Number
 * - Process Size
 * - Block number assigned to the process (or "Not Allocated" if no block fits)
 * - Remaining block size after allocation.
